# Abstract

As global biodiversity is rapidly declining due to habitat loss is important to determine how to protect it.
Still, the policies of many conservation agencies are prioritizing the preservation of a single large habitat area (SL) vs several small areas of the same size (SS), besides empirical support favor SS. Most of the theories regarding this issue were based on single-species models. The aim of this work is to explore spatial multi-species models to verify the SS > SL pattern and determine the causes of it. We used three types of models: a classical neutral, neutral with habitat selection, and a competitive hierarchical model.  All models have three parameters, extinction, reproduction, and dispersal distance. In the classical neutral model, species are equivalent and have the same parameters, when there is a reproduction event they send the propagule to a surrounding patch blindly, if the patch is already occupied the propagule dies. The neutral with habitat selection model is identical to the previous but the propagule selects an empty patch so their survival is ensured. In the hierarchical model species have competitive dominance and more dominant ones can replace the less dominant with a replacement rate parameter. We use 100 species and started simulating the colonization of an empty area then we destroy a fixed amount of habitat 60% using different regular patch sizes. The results for all models are almost always that SS retains more species than SL. The extinction of species in patches depends on the quotient between reproduction and extinction rates in relation to patch size. The only case when SL > SS is when dispersal is not enough to connect patches, and size is smaller than the minimum to prevent extinction. Then given that patch size is above the critical size to maintain populations the SS > SL pattern is due to the sampling effect of aggregated species distribution combined with the reduction of dispersal ability of species. High dispersal rates produce homogenization of species distribution and a reduction of species richness and this is why habitat fragmentation by habitat loss retains more species when patches are smaller. A prediction of the model is that if a set of species have more dispersal capabilities the SS effect would be lower than for species with less dispersal. 

One of the failures of previous theories is to not take into account that there are multiple threshold phenomena associated with the SS vs SL problem.


Dado que la biodiversidad an nivel global está disminuyendo rápidamente debido a la pérdida de hábitat, es importante determinar cómo protegerla, las políticas de muchas agencias de conservación priorizan la preservación de una sola área de hábitat grande (SL) frente a varias áreas pequeñas del mismo tamaño (SS) a pesar del apoyo empírico a favor de SS. La mayoría de las teorías sobre este tema se basaron en modelos de una sola especie. El objetivo de este trabajo es explorar modelos espaciales multiespecíficos para verificar el patrón SS> SL y determinar las causas del mismo. Usamos tres tipos de modelos: uno clásico neutral, neutral con selección de hábitat y un modelo jerárquico competitivo. Todos los modelos tienen tres parámetros, extinción, reproducción y distancia de dispersión. En el modelo neutral clásico, las especies son equivalentes y tienen los mismos parámetros, cuando hay un evento de reproducción envían el propágulo a un parche circundante a ciegas, si el parche ya está ocupado el propágulo muere. El modelo neutral con selección de hábitat es idéntico al anterior pero el propágulo selecciona un parche vacío para asegurar su supervivencia. En el modelo jerárquico, las especies más competitivas pueden reemplazar a las menos competitivas con una tasa de reemplazo. Usamos comunidad regional de 100 especies y simulamos la colonización de un área vacía, luego destruimos el 60% del hábitat usando diferentes tamaños de parches con distribución regular. Los resultados para todos los modelos son casi siempre que SS retiene más especies que SL. La extinción de especies en los parches de habitat depende del cociente entre las tasas de reproducción y extinción en relación con el tamaño del parche. Los únicos casos en el que SL> SS es cuando la dispersión no es suficiente para conectar parches y el tamaño es menor que el mínimo para evitar la extinción. Luego, cuando el tamaño del parche está por encima del tamaño crítico para mantener las poblaciones, el patrón SS> SL se debe al efecto de muestreo de la distribución agregada de especies combinado con la reducción de la capacidad de dispersión de las especies. Cuando no hay reduccion del hábitat, altas tasas de dispersión producen una homogeneización de la distribución de especies y una reducción de la riqueza. Cuando los parches de hábitat son mas pequeños quedan más especies diferentes dentro de los parches y debido a que la distancia entre parches reduce la dispersión. Una predicción del modelo es que si un conjunto de especies tiene más capacidades de dispersión, el efecto SS sería menor que para las especies con menos dispersión. Uno de los fracasos de las teorías anteriores es no tener en cuenta que existen múltiples fenómenos de umbral asociados al problema SS vs SL.

- A common belief in ecology is that there are not laws, ("Potentially, the most fundamental law in ecology is: It depends" @LeNematode) but I disagree, there are laws, and anomalies, and if we continue to believe that everything is an anomaly it will be more difficult to advance ecological science.

The second way is to get dissected. Building highways, cutting forests, and making large agricultural fields lead to the fragmentation of habitats for several species. The most worrying case is when the nonhabitat area is not suitable even for temporary survival (lb¼0). When h decreases below the critical hc, the population is confined to live in enclosures. Each finite subpopulation has a finite lifetime; therefore, extinctions from the habitat patches are inevitable. Having lb¼0, the empty good patches are unreachable for the species. Thus, a larger and larger proportion of the carrying capacity remains unexploited. If h is not far from hc, and lglc then the population can linger in the largest habitat fragments for a long time (Fig. 20.5). Although the equilibrium state is ^n ¼ 0, i.e. global extinction is certain, it may take a long time to reach the equilibrium.

Thethreshold-like nature of extinctions is an important message from percolation theory. All the control parameters, h, f,and l, have their own critical thresholds. (See the caption of Fig. 20.8 for the definition of l in a heterogeneous landscape.) It would be vital to know more about the interdependence of these parameters. Conservation biology should definitely benefit from this kind of information, because management efforts in nature reserves could be targeted to those control parameters which are close to a threshold. In the vicinity of the threshold, even a small management effort can have great effect on the prospects of survival; further away from the threshold, even large efforts are inefficient (see Fig. 20.3)

We used the IFM (Hanski, 1994) to quantify connectivity because this measure represents a key ecological process (range expansion), which incorporates ecological realism (e.g. metapopulation dynamics) and so produces more ecologically‐relevant outcomes compared to simpler approaches. Our results are comparable to those of more standard connectivity metrics (e.g. least‐cost models; see Appendix S4), but our IFM approach enables us to examine whether habitat networks of conservation set‐asides will allow species to colonize and persist over multiple generations (Hodgson et al., 2011). There is a need to develop modelling approaches that assess the resilience of ecological networks and that go beyond classic landscape connectivity estimates and incorporate ecological outcomes (Isaac et al., 2018). Our approach is therefore an improvement on standard connectivity metrics, but does not include parameters such as reproductive strategy or dispersal phase that are often included in more complex Individual Based Models (IBMs; e.g. see Synes et al., 2015), which are more flexible and predictive than IFMs, but also more computationally intensive. More research is needed to better understand the resilience of habitat networks and identify where connectivity losses are most critical.

@Thompson2019 Characterising extinction debt following habitat fragmentation using neutral theory

Habitat loss leads to species extinctions, both immediately and over the long term as ‘extinction debt’ is repaid. The same quantity of habitat can be lost in different spatial patterns with varying habitat fragmentation. How this translates to species loss remains an open problem requiring an understanding of the interplay between community dynamics and habitat structure across temporal and spatial scales. Here we develop formulas that characterise extinction debt in a spatial neutral model after habitat loss and fragmentation. Central to our formulas are two new metrics, which depend on properties of the taxa and landscape: ‘effective area’, measuring the remaining number of individuals and ‘effective connectivity’, measuring individuals’ ability to disperse through fragmented habitat. This formalises the conventional wisdom that habitat area and habitat connectivity are the two critical requirements for long-term preservation of biodiversity. Our approach suggests that mechanistic fragmentation metrics help resolve debates about fragmentation and species loss.

Everybody agrees that in the case of land-covering habitats such as forests, fragmentation makes little or no difference if the amount of habitat is large, roughly more than 20–30% of the landscape area (Lande, 1987; Andrén, 1994; Fahrig, 1998; Hanski, 2005), simply because all habitat is then relatively well connected. However, if the amount of habitat is smaller, fragmentation effects kick in and should not be ignored; this threshold is often referred to as the ‘20% rule’, although the value of the threshold naturally depends on the ecology of the species (see Fig. 1). Moreover, this level of habitat amount should not be confused with the extinction threshold, which sets the limit below which a species goes deterministically extinct at the landscape level. It should also be noted that the 20% rule applies to land-covering habitats, which originally covered most of the landscape. In contrast, many habitat types are naturally sparse and patchy, and the species inhabiting them may have become adapted, in one way or another, to extreme fragmentation, in which case much less habitat out of the total landscape area is sufficient for viable populations.

Is habitat fragmentation good for biodiversity?

Habitat loss is a primary threat to biodiversity across the planet, yet contentious debate has ensued on the importance of habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ (i.e., altered spatial configuration of habitat for a given amount of habitat loss). Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation effects is a ‘zombie idea’. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative effects of altered habitat configuration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientific disagreement, and informing conservation more effectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect influences of habitat loss and altered spatial configuration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation.

@Villard2014 Beyond the fragmentation debate: a conceptual model to predict when habitat configuration really matters


Reducing habitat loss should be a top priority for conservation planners. However, researchers should also investigate the indirect impacts of habitat loss on biodiversity through fragmentation effects. This research aims to identify windows of opportunity where habitat configuration can mitigate to some extent the effects of habitat loss, particularly through the maintenance of functional connectivity.
