## Plain Language Summary

Biodiversity is declining globally due to habitat loss, and conservation efforts need to focus on the best strategies to protect it. Traditionally, many conservation agencies prioritize preserving one large habitat area (SL) over several smaller areas of the same total size (SS), even though recent studies suggest SS is often more effective. To explore why this is the case, we used three models of species communities that simulate different scenarios of species survival and habitat loss. Our results show that SS tends to protect more species than SL in most cases. The only exception is when species cannot move between habitat patches and the patch size is too small to support populations. Additionally, species with higher dispersal abilities tend to benefit less from smaller habitat patches, as they spread more evenly across the landscape, reducing overall diversity.
