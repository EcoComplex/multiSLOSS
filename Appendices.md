![Relationship between number of species and habitat patch size for varying dispersal distances and growth rate parameters. Simulations were performed using a neutral model with a constant migration rate (0.0001). Following 200 time steps of the model, 60% of the habitat was destroyed, rendering it unavailable for the species. The destruction of habitat resulted in the formation of regular patterns, where all remaining patches exhibited equal sizes. ](Figures/Species_Habitat_Dispersal_Lambda_regular.png)

![Relationship between Shannon Diversity and habitat patch size for varying dispersal distances and growth rate parameters. Simulations were performed using a neutral model with a constant migration rate (0.0001). Following 200 time steps of the model, 60% of the habitat was destroyed, rendering it unavailable for the species. The destruction of habitat resulted in the formation of regular patterns, where all remaining patches exhibited equal sizes.](Figures/Shannon_Habitat_Dispersal_Lambda_regular.png)

![Relationship between number of species and maximum patch size for varying dispersal distances and growth rate parameters. Simulations were performed using a neutral model with a constant migration rate (0.0001). Following 200 time steps of the model, 60% of the habitat was destroyed, rendering it unavailable for the species. Habitat blocks of the same size (habitat patch size) were randomly distributed over the simulation grid. As a result, some patches overlapped, leading to a distribution of patch sizes. The range of patch sizes was determined by the habitat patch size parameter, defining the minimum and maximum sizes observed.](Figures/Species_MaxPatch_Dispersal_Lambda_block.png)
