![Relationship between number of species and maximum patch size for varying dispersal distances. Simulations were conducted using a model with 60% habitat destruction and regular habitat patterns, where all habitat patches are of equal size (i.e., the maximum patch size).](Figures/Species_MaxPatch_Dispersal_Lambda_regular.png)

![Relationship between Shannon Diversity and maximum patch size for varying dispersal distances. Simulations were conducted using a model with 60% habitat destruction and regular habitat patterns, where all habitat patches are of equal size (i.e., the maximum patch size).](Figures/Shannon_MaxPatch_Dispersal_Lambda_regular.png)

![Relationship between number of species and maximum patch size for varying dispersal distances. Simulations were conducted using a model with 60% habitat destruction and random block habitat patterns, where habitat blocks of the same size are randomly distributed over the simulation grid (i.e., the maximum patch size).](Figures/Species_MaxPatch_Dispersal_Lambda_block.png)
