![Relationship between number of species and maximum patch size for varying dispersal distances and growth rate parameters  (across panels). Simulations were performed using a neutral model with a constant migration rate (0.0001). Following 200 time steps of the model, 60% of the habitat was destroyed, rendering it unavailable for the species. Habitat blocks of the same size (habitat patch size) were randomly distributed over the simulation grid. As a result, some patches overlapped, leading to a distribution of patch sizes. The range of patch sizes was determined by the habitat patch size parameter, defining the minimum and maximum sizes observed.](Figures/Species_MaxPatch_Dispersal_Lambda_block.png)

![Relationship between number of species and habitat patch size for varying dispersal distances and growth rate parameters  (across panels). Simulations were performed using a competitive hierarchical model with constant migration and a replacement rate of 0.0001 and 0.3 respectively. Following 200 time steps of the model, 60% of the habitat was destroyed, rendering it unavailable for the species. The destruction of habitat resulted in the formation of regular patterns, where all remaining patches exhibited equal sizes.](Figures/Hierarchical_Species_Dispersal_Lambda_regular.png)

![Relationship between Number of Species and mean habitat patch size for different habitat destruction patterns (across panels) and varying dispersal distances. Simulations were performed using a neutral model with a constant migration rate (0.0001). Following 200 time steps of the model, 60% of the habitat was destroyed, rendering it unavailable for the species. In Random block habitat destruction, blocks of habitat with the same size (habitat patch size) were randomly distributed over the simulation grid. As a result, some patches overlapped, leading to a distribution of patch sizes. In regular habitat destruction the habitat patches are disposed with a regular pattern, so all remaining habitat patches exhibited equal sizes.](Figures/AcrossLoss_Species_Dispersal_Lambda2.png)
