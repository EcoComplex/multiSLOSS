## Abstract
 
As global biodiversity is rapidly declining due to habitat loss, it is important to determine how to protect it. Still, the policies of many conservation agencies are prioritizing the preservation of a single large habitat area (SL) vs. several small areas of the same size (SS), besides empirical support favouring SS. However, to date, most of the theories regarding this issue were based on single-species models. This work aims to explore spatial multi-species models to verify the SS > SL pattern and determine the causes of it. We used three types of models: a classical neutral, neutral with habitat selection, and a competitive hierarchical model.  All models have three parameters, extinction, reproduction, and dispersal distance. In the classical neutral model, species are equivalent and have the same parameters, when there is a reproduction event they send the propagule to a surrounding patch blindly, if the patch is already occupied the propagule dies. In the neutral-with-habitat selection model, the propagules select an empty patch so their survival is ensured. In the hierarchical model, species have competitive dominance and more dominant ones can replace the less dominant with a replacement rate parameter. We use 100 species and start simulating the colonization of an empty area then we destroy a fixed amount of habitat using different regular patch sizes. The results for all models are almost always that SS retains more species than SL. The extinction of species in patches depends on the quotient between reproduction and extinction rates in relation to patch size. The only case when SL > SS is when dispersal is not enough to connect patches, and patch size is smaller than the minimum to prevent extinction. If patch size is above the critical size to maintain local populations the SS > SL pattern is due to the sampling effect of aggregated species distribution combined with the reduction of dispersal ability of species. High dispersal rates produce homogenization of species distribution and a reduction of species richness and this is why habitat fragmentation by habitat loss retains more species when patches are smaller. The model predicts that if a set of species have more dispersal capabilities the SS effect would be lower than for species with less dispersal.

## Introduction 

Global biodiversity is rapidly declining due to habitat loss (quotes). Moreover, habitat fragmentation occurs at the same time as habitat loss, and the effects of both processes are difficult to disentangle. Landscape connectivity and organism mobility as a critical feature for population persistence [@Taylor1993]. Starting from a landmark paper [@Diamond1975], conservation biologists engaged in the challenging task of recommending protection measures given the environmental crisis coupled with a lack of knowledge of most of the world’s biodiversity. Early recommendations claimed to follow ecological theory, in particular island biogeography theory to derive simple thumb rules decisions to better design protected areas. However, as noted rapidly, species/area relationships do not have a clear association with fragmentation per se but only with overall habitat loss [@Simberloff1982].
Aiming to design better management practices, this has led to a nearly 50-year Single Large vs Several Small (SLOSS) debate. While some authors argue that habitat loss is the most overwhelming effect on species loss, for others the complex factors arising from fragmentation further enhance species extinctions [@Fahrig2017;@Fletcher2018].  

The SLOSS debate has been an important academic and practical discussion in conservation biology. In practice, a series of decision-maker targeted recommendations were proposed and remain rather uncritically in several conservation instances (quotes).
While the overall habitat loss is widely accepted as a process leading to long-term biodiversity loss (quotes), the proposition that single large reserves retain more species than several small reserves of the same area (SL > SS) remain at a similar hierarchical state, even after several criticisms (reviewed in  @Fahrig2017). Moreover, empirical observational and experimental data shows the predominance of the opposite pattern (SS > SL) ever since the 80s and this fact has been reinforced to this day [@Simberloff1982; @Fahrig2020; @Hammill2020], add more. The actual processes driving to it remain elusive and it is probably multi-causal (quotes). In that scenario, model simulations could produce useful predictions targeting the relevant variables in order to better understand the processes leading to non-intuitive patterns. 

The SLOSS debate has been approached from several theoretical frameworks, but most of them were based on single-species models. Moreover, spatial dimension in several works has been neglected as mere noise around long-term equilibrium dynamics (quotes, but see @Rybicki2013). In that context, spatial-explicit multi-species modelling could be meaningful as several organisms retain dispersal distance and other dispersal-related life traits far consistently among species (quotes).

The aim of this work is to explore spatial multi-species models to verify the SS > SL pattern and determine the causes of it. In particular, we simulate species retention after different fragmentation scenarios of the same overall habitat loss, therefore accounting for the interacting effects of habitat loss and fragmentation.

## Methods

### Model

The model represents a landscape occupied by multiple bird species that undergoes habitat degradation over time. The purpose is to explore the impact of fragmentation patterns and species interaction mechanisms on diversity and abundance distributions.

The environment comprises a 2D grid of patches that can be either suitable habitat or degraded. Bird agents have state variables for species identity, size, and colour. Globals contain key parameters.

At initialization, an intact landscape is seeded with bird agents having randomized species identities. Habitat loss occurs probabilistically at a set time step based on three spatial patterns: random, regular fragmentation, or block removal.

During each time step, the following sequence occurs:

Habitat loss event if scheduled

Calculation of probabilities for reproduction, dispersal, migration

Birds undergo probabilistic dispersal and reproduction based on:

Neutral model: Offspring disperse locally based on power law dispersal kernel and settle in any vacant habitat
Hierarchical model: Species can displace lower ranked species during dispersal
Immigration allows spontaneous appearance of birds at habitat edges

Data collection on species diversity, abundance, and spatial distribution

The model implements stochasticity in multiple processes including dispersal distance, loss patterns, migration, and species selection. Emergent macro-level diversity and abundance patterns result from individual-level bird behaviours.

Key outputs analyzed are species occupancy, diversity indices, abundance distributions, and spatial patterns. Experiments examine the dynamics under varying habitat loss, dispersal, and competition scenarios.

Regular habitat patterns: squares of a range of sizes are distributed regularly over the simulation grid. The side of the squares were 4,20,30,63 sites.

Random block habitat patterns: habitat blocks of the same size are randomly distributed over the simulation grid. The sizes are identical to those used for regular habitat simulations. This habitat simulation results in patches that have a minimum size equal to the block size but a maximum size that is bigger, so I characterize this with the maximum patch size.

## Discussion

Overall, our results confirm the previously found pattern and nearly all models retained more species under the SS rather than the SL scenario. In both cases, the loss of species is relevant when habitat loss takes place, and no significant extinction bias towards SS occurs as a long-term dynamic. The extinction of species in patches depends on the quotient between reproduction and extinction rates to patch size, i.e., the ability of a certain patch to be a source of propagules. The only case when SL > SS is when dispersal is not enough to connect patches, and size is smaller than the minimum to prevent patch extinction, as predicted elsewhere [@Rybicki2013]. Letting aside those cases (i.e., not reaching minimum dispersal distance and intra-patch sink dynamics), our model was able to produce the patterns observed so far in field studies [@Fahrig2020]. In that sense, we can hypothesize that our model variables (i.e., dispersal ability, patch size and lambda) may be biologically meaningful and enough to explain why SS retains more species than SL. Importantly, the spatial arrangement of available patches was not necessary to produce the spatial autocorrelation of occupied patches known to be responsible at least in part of the patterns observed in nature [@Fahrig2021]. In contrast, high dispersal rates produce homogenization of species distribution and a reduction of species richness, especially if high dispersal species are also good competitors. In that scenario, SS and SL are approximately equivalent for species diversity retention. The model predicts that if a set of species have more dispersal capabilities the SS effect would be smaller than for species with less dispersal abilities. 

Our model further illustrates that available patches are not always re-occupied following fragmentation even if the minimum size is met, therefore reinforcing the fact that dispersal is the main driver of the pattern, and that chance is involved in the final species pool when fragmentation takes place. Empirical data in large carnivores, for instance, support that several available patches are not occupied after isolation [@Paviolo2016]. 

@Rybicki2013 suggested that both short-term and long-term extinctions are produced after fragmentation. Here, we observed that, in most cases, long-term loss of species in SS scenarios were less important than short-term extinctions in SL scenario.
Overall, our results support the main conclusion by @Fahrig2021, in that the conditions for SL > SS are rather restricted and would not be observable in nature frequently (see @Fahrig2021, Fig 3). In contrast, if few conditions are met (minimum patch size and dispersal), SS would retain more species than SL for nearly all situations. Evidence suggests that small patches, even single structures such as isolated trees, can be important for biodiversity and landscape connectivity [@Shafer1995; @Manning2006]. While connectivity management is case-specific, our results further support past claims [@Fahrig2020;@Fahrig2021], that assuming that SL is always better does not have empirical support. In our work, spreading of risk was not modelled (__maybe as time lag in at-patch competition?__), therefore reinforcing that the sampling effect is enough to produce an SS > SL pattern if dispersal is small enough to produce spatial autocorrelation of occupied patches [@Simberloff1976].

One large patch can enhance competitive exclusion, and that is more important the more similar species are. Hummingbirds?

### Limitations

We acknowledge the limitations of our study and consider it a strength that we have identified in this initial model. This allows us to continue working on them in future research.

Matrix is assumed as non-habitat

Genetic structured not considered

We are not modeling total diversity, rather diversity of a certain group with a set of similar species
